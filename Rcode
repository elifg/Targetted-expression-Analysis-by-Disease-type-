## Objective:
Identifying the relevant oncological disease types/cohorts for their solid tumor immunotherapy.

### Code:
```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(FirebrowseR)
library(ggplot2)
TCGA_cohort = Metadata.Cohorts(format="csv",cohort="")$cohort
#Issue on retrieving data for FPPP cohort using FirebrowseR, so I removed FPPP from cohort list.
TCGA_cohort=TCGA_cohort[TCGA_cohort!="FPPP"]
Median=""
#NOTES: From gene card: PD-1:PDCD1|CD279 & PD-L1:CD274 
for(x in (TCGA_cohort)){
	PD1 = Analyses.mRNASeq.Quartiles(format = "csv", gene = "PDCD1", cohort = x, protocol = "RSEM", sample_type = "tumors", Exclude = "")
	PDL1 = Analyses.mRNASeq.Quartiles(format = "csv", gene = "CD274", cohort = x, protocol = "RSEM", sample_type = "tumors", Exclude = "")
	Median[x]= paste (PD1$median, '\t', PDL1$median)
					   }
write.table(Median,"Median_Expression.tsv", sep="\t",row.names=TRUE, col.names =FALSE, quote = FALSE)
mydata=read.table("Median_Expression.tsv",sep="\t")

lm_eqn <- function(m){
    eq <- substitute(italic(y) == a + b %.% italic(x)*","~~italic(pval)~"="~p*","~~italic(r)^2~"="~r2, 
                     list(a = format(coef(m)[1], digits = 2), 
                          b = format(coef(m)[2], digits = 2),
                          p = format(summary(fit)$coefficients[2,4], digits = 2),
                          r2 = format(summary(m)$r.squared, digits = 2)))
    as.character(as.expression(eq));                 
}
fit <- lm(X.1 ~ X, data = mydata)
MyPlot=ggplot(mydata, aes(x=X, y=X.1)) +
    labs(x = "PD-1 (median log2 expression)", y ="PD-L1 (median log2 expression)")+
    geom_point(size=2.5, shape=19,color = "yellowgreen")+
    geom_text(label=rownames(mydata),fontface="bold",size = 3.0,color="orange",hjust=0.25, vjust=1.5)+
    geom_smooth(method="lm", se=TRUE, level=0.5)+
    geom_text(x=7.5,y=2.0,size = 3.0, label = lm_eqn(fit), parse = TRUE)
#MyPlot
```
### Scatterplot comparing median RSEM normalized expression per cohort of PD-1 vs PD-L1

```{r,echo=FALSE}
MyPlot
```

### Notes:


The median RSEM normalized expression  of PD-1 and PD-L1 per cohort, sorted by descending combined expression were stored in file **Median_Expression.tsv**

## Summary:

As illustrated in the scatterplot of the median log2 expression for genes; PD-1 and PD-L1 per cancer cohort (from TCGA), we can conclude that these two genes exhibit a significant association (p=0.002, r^2=0.24) across all reported cancers, The most relevant oncological disease cohorts for their solid tumor immunotherapy based on current data analysis with the highest median co-expression would be DLBC, also PAAD and BRCA can be considered as they perfectly aligns with the predicted relationship between PD-1 and PD-L1.
